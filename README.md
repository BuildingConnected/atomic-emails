# Atomic Emails

A toolkit for building emails.

Atomic Emails is a collection of utilities that helps you build emails that are compatible with a variety of email clients. As most web developers know, when you build a website you should ensure it looks good and works well in all the major browsers. Similarly, when you build an email you need to ensure it looks good in all the major email clients. Unfortunately, there are many more email clients than there are major browsers, and many of them use different engines to render html. Some of these engines are very old, and do not support common css styles and element properties. This can make it quite challenging for the developer to implement beautiful designs in emails.

Atomic Emails provides the following packages:

- [Email Style Validator](https://github.com/BuildingConnected/atomic-emails/tree/master/packages/email-style-validator)
- WithEmailValidation - React Higher Order Component (coming soon)
- React Atomic Email Components (coming soon)
- Server Side Email Renderer (coming soon)
